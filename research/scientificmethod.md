What is our problem statement?
When and where do we predict West Nile Virus to be present in the city?

What can we learn from the data in order to make an educated hypothesis? What is our hypothesis?
We will likely be basing this on location, weather, and how long it's been since spraying took place. No obvious correlations jump out, but based on the knowledge that  hot and dry conditions are supposed to favor West Nile Virus, the hypothesis is that the virus will be most common in areas with higher temperatures and longer time elapsed since last rain or spray.
