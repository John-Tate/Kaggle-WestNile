Define your deliverable- what is the end result?
Break that deliverable up into its components, and then go further down the rabbit hole until you have actionable items.
Document these however you wish- github, a project management tool, post-it notes- whatever works for your team.
Begin deciding priorities for each task. These are subject to change, but it's good to get an initial consensus. Order these priorities however you would like.
